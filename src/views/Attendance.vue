    <h1>Help!</h1>
    <p>Darin is a good boy and has zero absences and zero tardies. As such, he can not implement this page properly.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, if you are a juvenile delinquent and frequently skip class, please consider putting your terrible decisions to good use and help me write this page.</p>
    <p>Much thanks if you do!</p>
